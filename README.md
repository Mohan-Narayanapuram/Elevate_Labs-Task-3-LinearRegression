# Task 3: Linear Regression – Elevate Labs Internship

## Objective
To implement and understand Simple Linear Regression using the Housing dataset, and evaluate the model's performance with key metrics.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Files Included
- `task3_linear_regression.ipynb` – Complete notebook for model training and evaluation
- `Housing.csv` – Dataset containing area and price
- `README.md` – This file

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Selected `'area'` as the independent feature and `'price'` as the target
3. Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20)
4. Trained a `LinearRegression` model using `scikit-learn`
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. Visualized the regression line over actual data

## Model Output
- MAE: 1474748.1337969352
- MSE: 3675286604768.185
- R² Score: 0.27287851871974644

## Key Takeaways
- The model successfully predicts housing price based on area
- Positive linear relationship between area and price
- Linear regression is interpretable and fast for numeric prediction problems
